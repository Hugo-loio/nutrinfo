# nutrinfo

A simple Python CLI program that allows users to input and save custom nutrition tables of ingredients and then combine them to generate the nutrition table of a recipe.

Only the main macronutrients are supported, and the final table for the recipe produces values per 100 g.

Install with 

    ./install.sh

Unistall with 

    ./uninstall.sh

The cli tool will be available as `nutrinfo`. Data will be locally saved in the current working directory.
